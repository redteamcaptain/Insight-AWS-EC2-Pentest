# Insight Security Fellowship AWS Infrustructure Audit
As part of the Insight Security Fellowship Program, I decided to do a security audit and penetration test of Insight's ICON blockchain validator node running on AWS EC2. The main subjects of the audit are the deployment pattern (Terraform & Ansible) and the resulting live validator node running Ubuntu.

## Background
The methodology revolves around catching bugs earlier in the SDLC. Forward thinking companies integrate security as early as possible, as they are orders of magnitude cheaper to fix the earlier you catch them.

Lots of the work is securing your pipeline (dependency management, container scanning, repo security) and infrastructure (usually cloud security/Kubernetes).

## Summary

## Scoping
The project has a tiered scope due to time limitations.
- Stage 1: Live Node
- Stage 2: Deployment Pattern and Ansible/Terraform resources
- Stage 3:
